## A web map built with React and the ArcGIS JS API, and consuming ArcGIS Online resources

### Objectives

- Display the polygons, styled by a variable
- Display polygon information upon click events
- Allow the user to select a different variable to map
- Allow the user to select a language (EN/SP)

### Steps

- #### Setup

  - Use create-react-app to initialize a React app with NPM in the current folder
    > > npx create-react-app .

- #### Outcome

- #### Notes
  - Use only ES modules (ESM) via CDN for testing and prototyping, as it is not optimized for fast loading. Instead, build the ES modules locally (via NPM, which what we are doing) or use AMD modules via the ArcGIS CDN.
